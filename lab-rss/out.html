    </a>
    <p>
    </p><p>PHP is experiencing a renaissance, though it may be difficult
 to tell with all of the outdated PHP tutorials online. With this 
practical guide, you will learn how PHP has become a full-featured, 
mature language with object-orientation, namespaces, and a growing 
collection of reusable component libraries. Author Josh Lockhart, 
creator of PHP The Right Way, reveals these new language features in 
action. You will learn best practices for application architecture and 
planning, databases, security, testing, debugging, and deployment. If 
you have a basic understanding of PHP and want to bolster your skills, 
this is your book.</p>
